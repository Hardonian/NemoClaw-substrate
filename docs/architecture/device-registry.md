# Device registry foundation

Implemented `DeviceRegistry` with deterministic ordering and explicit stale/missing-node semantics via `registerNode`, `removeNode`, `updateHeartbeat`, `updateCapabilities`, `getNode`, `listNodes`, and `summarizeHealth`.

This is infrastructure-only: no autodiscovery and no routing side effects.

Future seams: queue-aware orchestration, GPU telemetry adapters, distributed-worker adapters.

## 2026-05-09 adapter/dry-run update
Worker/provider adapter contracts and scheduler-to-provider dry-run bridge are implemented for diagnostics and receipt/event emission only. Live provider routing is unchanged. Remote execution, Dynamo adapters, and GPU telemetry remain planned future work.


## Worker probe and telemetry adapter note (2026-05-09)
- Probes are explicit operator-invoked actions (manual/invoked-only), not autonomous loops.
- Remote execution remains disabled in this phase; governed routing remains opt-in.
- Telemetry fields can be unavailable/stale and are surfaced truthfully without fabrication.
- Dynamo integration is planned only and not implemented.


## 2026-05-09 telemetry truth update
- Telemetry is explicit probe-only and best effort.
- Unavailable telemetry is acceptable and non-fatal.
- No background polling daemons are introduced.
- Telemetry is observed only through explicit probes; future scheduling use is planned and remains unavailable unless observed.
- Routing defaults remain unchanged; telemetry is non-authoritative metadata.

## Telemetry registry provenance

Device registry telemetry snapshots preserve source attribution and stale/conflict markers. Unavailable telemetry does not clear previously observed inventory.

## Worker trust and attestation constraints (2026-05-09)
- Self-reported claims are evidence only and are **not automatically trusted**.
- Probe-observed evidence improves visibility but is **not authorization**.
- Operator approval is explicit and required before remote trust elevation.
- Revoked, expired, or conflict-detected workers are blocked/degraded for remote execution paths.
- Cryptographic attestation is not implemented yet in this phase.
- Remote execution is disabled by default and requires explicit opt-in flags.
- No orchestration/Dynamo integration is implemented in this phase.
