# Telemetry adapters

Telemetry availability is explicit. If GPU telemetry is unavailable, diagnostics and probe events emit an unavailable/degraded truth state instead of inferred telemetry.


## 2026-05-09 telemetry truth update
- Telemetry is explicit probe-only and best effort.
- Unavailable telemetry is acceptable and non-fatal.
- No background polling daemons are introduced.
- Telemetry is observed only through explicit probes; future scheduling use is planned and remains unavailable unless observed.
- Routing defaults remain unchanged; telemetry is non-authoritative metadata.

## Telemetry adapters evidence policy

Remote/local telemetry adapters are evidence-only and may return unavailable without failing routing. No background polling is introduced.
## 2026-05-09 telemetry operational taxonomy hardening
- Added dedicated telemetry operational event kinds for probe lifecycle, parser outcomes, availability/staleness/conflict signals, and registry update decisions.
- Event payloads carry runtime/source attribution, confidence, and degraded reason codes while avoiding secret-bearing fields.
- Legacy consumers that read `degraded_state` / `runtime_action` continue to function; telemetry adds explicit categories for higher-fidelity replay and observability.
